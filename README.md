Subject: Summary of Work Completed on August 2, 2023 and Plans Moving Forward

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to provide a summary of the tasks I completed on August 2, 2023, and my plans for the coming days.

Here's a breakdown of my activities:

Tutorial Completion and Configuration of Struts 2 Framework: In the first part of my workday, I successfully finished Tutorial 1, which included configuring the dependencies for the Struts 2 framework. Despite encountering a version error, I was able to resolve it promptly. Also, I now understand the importance of 'clean' and 'install' commands in Maven after each configuration.

Java Knowledge Revision: In the second part of my workday, I spent time revisiting various Java-related knowledge. This was an invaluable exercise to reinforce my understanding of key principles and concepts.

Project Requirement Understanding: Lastly, I reviewed the project requirements forwarded by Tian-hao. The documentation indicated that the back-end should be developed using Spring. I'd like to have a conversation about the feasibility of using Struts 2 instead and the potential benefits or drawbacks compared to using Spring.

As for my plan moving forward:

Continued Struts 2 Learning: I intend to continue my study of Struts 2 following the official tutorial. My next goal is to complete the second tutorial to further solidify my understanding and skills in this area.

Web Application Project: Subsequent to this, I will try to tackle a larger web application project using Struts 2. However, I am unsure about the timeline for completion as I might need to learn and implement simultaneously.

I am committed to ensuring that my work contributes to the success of our project. If you have any questions about my work or additional tasks you'd like me to undertake, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,

[Your Name]
